## 2. Fundamentals of Stocks
### Inflation
- **Inflation**: Decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time. A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over some period of time
- Everything gets more expensive over time
- Government wants there to be an inflation: target inflation. 
- Inflation is often measured using the Consumer Price Index
- **Consumer Price Index** (CPI): a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them.
- Indexes are formulae that keep track of things - there are indexes for stocks, housing etc.
- **Because of inflation, if we don't spend our money right away, our money will be worth less.** ðŸ˜²
- Cash is thus the *worst long term* investment you can have.
- We need to beat inflation with our investments

### Compounding
- **Compounding**: Process of reinvesting the interest earned on your investment so that during the next period, you earn interest not only on the invested capital but also the accumulated interest
- $10_000 @ 10 % interest * 20 years
  - Simple interest: $20_000
  - Compound interest: $37_275

## 3. Stocks
-  **Private corporation**: a business entity owned by a small number of shareholders. Private corporations don't issue shares to the public. Since private corporations don't opt for an initial public offering (IPO), their shares are not traded on stock exchanges. 
- In general, the shares of these businesses are less liquid, and **their valuations are more difficult to determine.** 
- The high costs of an IPO is one reason companies choose to stay private.
- **If someone sues you for a product malfunction, they can't sue you- they can only sue the private corporation that makes them.**
- So there's limited liability. Plus lots of tax benefits (because companies have expenses)
- **Stocks (or shares)**: Investments that represent part ownership in a corporation. When you buy shares in a company, you own portionally a part of that company.
- Its not easy selling equity to people- you need to know the person, you need to see a lawyer, draft and sign a document. This is where a public corporation comes in. ðŸŽŠ
