## Narrative

### How to find your voice
1. What's your actual intention? => Content
   1. Informative
   2. Persuasive
   4. Entertain
   5. Inspire

2. Who is your intented audience => Tone

Eg. I want to persuade staff already demoralized due to a badly handled and expensive restructuring to accept pay cuts- and not think of leaving.

- jot down 6 or 7 things you want to say to achieve this objective
  - i understand we mishandled the resturcture
  - things must be exhausting
  - we made some mistakes but we're correcting them
  - our vision is to ...
  - we do not plan to let go of anyone
  - accept a pay cut 
  - long run

- Intent + Audience = Content + Tone + Pace
- Eg. If audience is Investors, be authoritative, well informed, and fast paced 
- Eg. Funeral speech - compassionate, repectful, unhurried, longer sentences
